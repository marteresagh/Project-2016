# 2. 3D modeling
This project consists in reproducing graphically the house of the Parliament of Bangladesh: **National Assembly Building**, designed by **Louis Kahn**. 

The exterior of the building is striking in its simplicity, with huge walls and large openings of regular geometric shapes.

The building consists of nine individual blocks that I have recreated separately.

## Minister's lounge
This is the building that houses **residences** for the members of the Parliament. It is located on the west side.

To model this structure I designed the skeleton of plan.

I extruded the walls from the plan and added details like stairs, windows and floors.

## Office
This is the building of the **offices**. It is repeated four times around the centrale area.

The plan is simply and the sides have holes of **geometric shapes**: triangles, rectangles and circles.

## Prayer hall
This is the prayer hall, located in the south side. It is **rotated** about six degrees with respect to the main building, to line the west wall with La Mecca.

For this building I have not used the design of the floor plan, but I created the **cylindrical columns** and the **curved walls** with specific functions.

Then I created the holes for windows and doors, and added grates, floors and other details.

## Dinning and recreation
The **dinning** and **recreation building** is situated in the east side. 

To model this, I extruded walls that interested me from the plan skeleton.

For front side I drew the wall with geometrical holes, and I extruded the surface.  

Then I added the windows on the side walls, building a **pattern**, consisting of beam and grates, to be repeated.

## Entrance hall
This building is the **north entrance**, overlooking the Presidential Plaza.

In this case the basic plan is very simple.

Then I added **perforated oblique walls**, floors, balconies and gate. I created the holes for windows on the sides and grids.

## Central area
The **central area**, octagonal in shape, is formed by the **assembly chambe**r in the center and the **hallways** that surround it.
I used the plan as a reference point to position the various walls.
I created a **pattern** of walls and then repeating it in rotation I built the entire structure.
The **parabolic shell roof** is built using ruled surfaces, that is, eight cones with apexes at the center of the building.

For particular holes on the walls I drew the shape and then I extruded surface.

For details like **stairs** and **railings** I used appropriate functions written by me.

# 3. Texture & Furniture
The **material** used for the entire structure is **concrete**, coated with white **marble** strips to mask the joints of the building. So I created the texture and I applied it to all the walls. I also rebuilt part of the furniture using simple geometries.
